only need to include the "disco.hpp" file

will need to add comments and parameter stuff to each module definition and implementation



# NOTE:
`DATA_PIN` was changed to `MATRIX_DATA_PIN` in the disco_peripherals.h file because `DATA_PIN` is declared somewhere generically inside the FastLED library

(recent update compiled properly, has not been fully tested on physical esp32)
